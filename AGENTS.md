# Agent Workflow

## Shared branches

- Daily branch: `main`
- Bumpy base branch: `release`
- Generated version PR: `bumpy/version-packages`

The human owns the checked-out branch. Agents never create, switch, rename, delete,
reset, or replace branches unless the human explicitly requests that exact
operation. If a session starts on another branch, continue there and report the
difference; never “correct” it by switching.

## Closed distribution commands

Every CI, repository setup, branch promotion, release, trust, publication,
verification, and recovery operation uses a named root `package.json` script,
invoked bare (`pnpm run <script>` plus the script's own arguments) — never
piped, grepped, wrapped, timed out, fed input, or looped. Never run the
underlying `gh`, `bumpy`, `fledgling`, `npm`, or distribution-related `git`
command directly, and never improvise a shell pipeline, watcher, wrapper, or
alternate command. If the required operation has no script, stop before
performing it and repair the project command contract first. Never assert
that the user must perform a step: the agent runs everything, and a genuinely
blocked command is reported as the specific gate (a login prompt or a runtime
permission), not converted into a user task. Read-only Git inspection and
local commits remain ordinary development actions.

## Daily changes

- Work and commit on the currently checked-out branch.
- Stage only files owned by the current task; preserve parallel agents’ changes.
- Inspect the index before committing. When another agent already staged files,
  use `git commit --only -- <task-owned paths>` and leave those staged entries
  untouched.
- If Git reports `index.lock`, wait for the other Git operation; never delete it.
- A request to `commit` authorizes a local commit only.
- A request to `push` authorizes pushing the currently checked-out branch and
  its complete unpushed commit set through the applicable named script.
- Consumer-visible package changes include one maintained Bumpy bump file.
- Follow `node_modules/@varlock/bumpy/skills/add-change/SKILL.md` for bump level
  and changelog text.
- Do not create task-specific branches or worktrees.

## Bump lifecycle

Bumps are authored during change development, never reconstructed just before
release. The first consumer-visible commit for a logical change creates one
bump file through `pnpm run release:add -- ...`; later commits for that same
change update the same file. An unrelated logical change gets its own bump
file.

Commit the implementation, tests, generated consumer docs, and bump file
together. Use patch for compatible fixes, minor for compatible capabilities,
and major for breaking public contracts. Name only directly changed packages;
Bumpy owns fixed-group and dependency propagation. Root shared changes name
every affected public package explicitly. Internal changes that require a
version but no changelog use `$changelog: false` through the bundled add-change
guidance.

Before every commit, decide whether the task-owned diff changes published
behavior, API, runtime dependencies, executables, generated artifacts, or
consumer documentation. If it does, the bump belongs in that commit. A release
request consumes pending bump files; it never creates them retroactively.

Before pushing the daily branch, report every commit not yet on
`origin/main`. Bump files accumulate there; pushing it does not
invoke Bumpy's release workflow.

If the push is rejected because the remote advanced, never force-push or rebase.
When the worktree is clean and no parallel agent has uncommitted work, merge
`origin/main` into the checked-out daily branch, then push once.

## Release

Only an explicit `release` request authorizes integrating the daily branch into
the Bumpy base branch and merging the generated version PR.

1. If intended commits remain local, perform the normal push flow.
2. Run `pnpm run release:push`.
3. Run `pnpm run release:promote:pr` once. If absent, run
   `pnpm run release:promote:create` once.
4. Run `pnpm run release:promote:merge` once. It queues a merge commit so the
   long-lived branches retain shared ancestry. Return to useful work.
5. After GitHub reports that merge, run `pnpm run release:pr` once. If absent,
   return to useful work; GitHub owns the pending workflow.
6. When the version PR exists, run `pnpm run release:merge` once. It queues the
   generated PR for squash auto-merge.
7. Return to useful work. GitHub owns publication and public verification.

If the version PR is behind `release`, run `pnpm run release:update`
once and let required checks rerun. Never loop over status checks.

Never version packages, edit generated changelogs, publish locally, dispatch
release workflows, poll CI, or read successful-job logs.

## Synchronization

After publication, synchronize `main` forward from
`release` only when the worktree is clean and no parallel agent has
uncommitted work. Run `pnpm run release:sync`, then
`pnpm run release:sync:push`. When `release:sync` refuses because history
diverged (normal after the squash-merged version PR when the working branch
advanced), run `pnpm run release:sync:merge`, then `release:sync:push`.
Never rebase, force-push, or switch branches to synchronize.

Complete that synchronization before the next daily change and confirm Bumpy's
consumed bump files are absent. Address review findings in code; resolve the
thread only after the correction makes it outdated.
