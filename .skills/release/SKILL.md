# Release packages

Use only the repository's named root scripts for every release operation.
Never run their underlying `gh`, `bumpy`, `npm`, `fledgling`, or `git` commands
directly. A missing command is a project setup defect and must be added before
release continues.

For a consumer-visible package change, follow
`node_modules/@varlock/bumpy/skills/add-change/SKILL.md` and commit its bump file
with the implementation on the checked-out working branch. Pushing the working
branch only accumulates bump files; Bumpy creates or updates
`bumpy/version-packages` when the promotion merge reaches the base branch, and
nothing publishes until that generated PR merges.

Create the bump with the first consumer-visible commit for that logical change.
Update the same bump as the change evolves. Give unrelated logical changes
separate bump files. Commit implementation, tests, generated consumer docs,
and the bump together. Never wait for a release request to reconstruct bumps
from commit history.

An explicit release request authorizes this exact sequence:

```sh
pnpm run release:push
pnpm run release:promote:pr
pnpm run release:promote:create # only when the previous command found no PR
pnpm run release:promote:merge
```

Return to useful work. After GitHub reports the promotion merge:

```sh
pnpm run release:pr
pnpm run release:merge
```

Run `release:merge` only when `release:pr` returned the version PR. Required
checks gate both merges. GitHub owns publication and public verification. After
publication, on the clean working branch run `release:sync` and
`release:sync:push`. Inspect workflows only after failure. Never version,
publish, dispatch, or poll locally.
